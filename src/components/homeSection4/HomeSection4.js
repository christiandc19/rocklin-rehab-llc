            <p>
              At Rocklin Rehab, we offer different levels of care based on each
              individual’s needs. Our programs consist of an intensive
              outpatient program (IOP) and a more demanding and structured
              partial hospitalization program (PHP). <br /> <br /> You can be
              confident that our caring and professional staff will recommend
              the right level of care for you or your loved one.
            </p>{" "}

            <h1>TREATMENT</h1>
            <p>
              All treatment clients will have a recovery/treatment plan
              developed within 30 days of admission. Measurement and
              reassessment of treatment plan progress happen on a weekly basis
              through the weekly summary. <br /> <br /> In the weekly summary,
              the drug and alcohol counselor will ensure that action steps to be
              taken by client or counselor are on target and that the action
              step achievements will enable resolution of the objective. All
              treatment plans are reviewed by and signed off on by the clinical
              director.
